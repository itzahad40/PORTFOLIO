      <p>
        I am Ahad Ali, an enthusiastic web developer and tech learner currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) at Meerut Institute of Technology.
        With a passion for building user-friendly and responsive web applications, I enjoy combining design with clean code.<br />I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science student with a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and software development principles.<br /> I enjoy building real-world applications, exploring new technologies, and continuously improving my coding skills.

I have hands-on experience with languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I'm familiar with tools and frameworks like Git, React, and Node.js.<br /> Through academic projects, internships, and personal initiatives, I've worked on web applications, algorithms, and data structures, sharpening both my technical and teamwork abilities.

Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to grow as a software developer—whether through internships, collaborative projects, or mentorships.<br /> I'm especially interested in backend development, full-stack roles, and contributing to products that have a positive impact.

Let's connect if you're looking for someone eager to learn, ready to contribute, and passionate about building great software.
